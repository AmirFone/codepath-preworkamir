**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Amir Hossain**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/powerful-harvest-hacksaw)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    There were many challenges I faced during the submission of this         file. I think I mainly face these challenges because I have never         created my Repository on GitHub and uploaded files.  But thankfully,     code path offers many helpful videos on how to upload files and           videos to GitHub Repositories. One thing that I also appreciate is       the use of glitch, which makes website development so much easy for       beginners, and I'm glad then I'm aware of this resource now because I     know that without this resource it would have been a lot more          difficult for me to create this game.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

The one question that I have is how would I have an Interactive website using the cursor. For example, I am interested to know how I would make up a web game that uses the cursor as control. This is fascinating to me because the cursor is not like a button and needs to be updated every millisecond, and I'm interested in how that would be implemented. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would work on adding more optional features like adding more than four functional game buttons, which should not be that complicated because I would just have to create a new HTML line and follow the same template as I did for the other buttons. I would also like to speed up the game such that after each consecutive round, the player guesses correctly, the game gives you less time for the next round. This is a complex problem to solve because I would need a timer float variable that speeds up by 20% each round, And when the time is up, the game ends.
